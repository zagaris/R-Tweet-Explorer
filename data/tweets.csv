Day 4️⃣ Time series modelling

featuring the following packages:

📦 gratis @YanfeiKang &amp; co
📦🇦🇺 tsibble @earowang &amp; co
📦🇦🇺 fable @mitchoharawild &amp; co

Admittedly, I know very little about time series so come learn along with me!

Next, I'm going to study some synthetic time series data using {gratis} by @YanfeiKang &amp; co 🕰️

Steps involve:

1. Define a parametric model: e.g., arima_model()
2A. Use generate() for tsibble output
2B. Use simulate() for ts output
3. Plot it!

🕰️ The non-standard time index in {tsibble} like `yearmonth`, `yearweek` and `yearquarter` comes with a set of default `scale_*` functions that make prettier scales automatically for you in #ggplot !

📦 {fable} by @mitchoharawild &amp; co is well known for tidy forecasting but this time I'm putting it to test it's ability for modelling!

🎯 Fit an ARIMA model via {fable}:

1. with auto parameter selection 
2. with true order 

✔️ Result: not bad!

📦 {tsibble} uses {vctrs} to define a number of special vector classes.

This includes representing non-standard time index like:

📅 year-week (with default day starting on Monday)
🗓️ year-month 
📆 year-quarter (year starting on Jan)

⏳ Once upon a time (&amp; still now), time series data in #rstats are often stored as ts objects. In this format, time index is an _attribute_ rather than a variable

⌛ {tsibble} by @earowang &amp; co modernises to tidy data making it easier to work with #tidyverse
