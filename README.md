# R-Tweet-Explorer
=====================================================

## How it works

R Tweet Explorer searches for daily tweets with the hashtag #rstats and creates a simple flexdashboard that displays and analyze the data in categories and creates interactive plots.

For the data fetching part i am using rtweet that is a client library in R for accessing Twitterâ€™s REST and stream APIs and for the plotting part i am using echarts4r.
